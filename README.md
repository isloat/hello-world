# hello-world
First repository submitted to Github!

Tell a bit about myself? Okay, well, I've been bouncing in and out of college for several years and realized that I'm much more productive when I self-teach and figure things out on my own. Now I'm digging deep into learning several coding languages (practical applications of such, that is -- I have a solid background in computer science), as well as Git and various other methods of making my life much easier. 

I also ramble.
